## Description
Embark on a journey of absurdity in this console game where your sole objective is to navigate from a randomly selected starting Wikipedia article, cleverly dubbed Article A, to an equally arbitrary finishing destination, aptly named Article B. Prepare yourself for a quirky and intellectually whimsical experience as you traverse the vast expanse of Wikipedia.
